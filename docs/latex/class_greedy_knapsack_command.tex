\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\doxylink{class_command}{Command} to solve the Knapsack problem using a greedy heuristic. 

This class implements the \doxylink{class_command}{Command} interface and provides an approximate solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem by selecting items based on their value-\/to-\/weight ratio. While not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, this method is fast and often yields good results for large instances. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
